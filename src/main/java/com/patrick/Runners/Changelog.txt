< Tuesday 3/4/2021 - Able to add runners to DB from frontend
Tuesday 3/4/2021 - gets the runners from RDBMS


To Do:

Users Management
* Form to Register Users
* Page that shows all users
    * Only viewable to Admins
    * Maybe an approval process? I can approve users

Runners
* add photos to teams (upload files??)
* Individual records for each runner? Add PRs?

Infra
* Put project in a container
* Create New Cypress, currently using local cypress-202 project
